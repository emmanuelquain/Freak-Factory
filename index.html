        <p>ARTIST STATEMENT: </p>
  
        <p2>For Project 3, I wanted to make a character creator as it's a type of game interaction that has always been a part of my life. When I was young, I would play many games with my sister on our family computer. Games like The Sims and Spore were customization games that my sister and I would play for hours. Even as an adult, my love for character customization is something that continues through games like Legends of Zelda: Breath of the Wild which allows the player to customize the main character by giving them different outfits, or Monster Hunter which enables the player to customize the look of their character and armorsets. Another thing I wanted to do with this project was play around with the background of CSS.
